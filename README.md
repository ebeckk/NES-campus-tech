# FlexiFairy

FlexiFairy is a **campus tech app** that helps students connect by posting their flexi **needs** (requests) and what they **can offer** (as flexifairies). It’s a simple and social way to exchange support on campus — whether that’s study help, dining hall swipes, or a quick favor.

Built with a **FastAPI backend** and a **React Native frontend**, FlexiFairy lets users browse, filter, and post offers and requests in real-time, with secure authentication via Firebase.
